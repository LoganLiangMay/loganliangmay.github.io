# Gotham Bold (self-hosted)

Place your **Gotham Bold** font files here so the site can use them:

- `Gotham-Bold.woff2` (preferred)
- `Gotham-Bold.woff` (fallback for older browsers)

**File names must match** what `styles.css` expects, or update the `@font-face` `url()` paths.

**License:** Gotham is a commercial font by [Hoefler&Co](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview). You need a license to use it. If you have access via **Adobe Fonts**, you can sync Gotham there and export `.woff2`/`.woff` for self-hosting if your license allows.
